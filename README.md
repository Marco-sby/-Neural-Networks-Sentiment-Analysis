# 💻 Machine Learning Project – Neural Networks & Sentiment Analysis

This project is part of a machine learning coursework and focuses on applying two distinct approaches:

1. **Neural Networks for Regression** – predicting customer income based on bank record data.
2. **Semantic Analysis** – extracting and analyzing sentiment from social media text.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Marco2020333_ML_CA2.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook containing all code, analysis, and visualizations
- `BankRecords.csv` – Dataset used for the neural network regression task (not included due to size/privacy)
- `Text data` – Collected from a social media platform for sentiment analysis

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NLTK / TextBlob / Vader (for NLP & sentiment analysis)

---

## 🧠 Task 1: Predicting Income with Neural Networks

- **Dataset**: BankRecords.csv
- **Goal**: Predict `Income (Thousands)` from customer data
- **Process**:
  - Data Cleaning & Encoding
  - Feature Selection
  - Neural Network Modeling with Keras
  - Model Tuning and Evaluation
  - Comparison with another regressor (e.g., Linear Regression or Random Forest)

---

## 💬 Task 2: Sentiment Analysis

- **Data**: Scraped from a chosen topic on a social media platform
- **Techniques**:
  - Text Preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, etc.)
  - Sentiment Scoring using NLP tools
  - Visualization of sentiment distribution

---

## 📊 Results Summary

- Achieved good performance on the income prediction model with tuned neural networks
- Clear visualization of public sentiment on the chosen topic
- Comparison with traditional ML methods provided additional insights
